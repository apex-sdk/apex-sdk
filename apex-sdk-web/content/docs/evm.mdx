# PolkaVM & Solidity Integration

**Apex SDK enables high-performance PolkaVM/Solidity contract deployment and interaction on Polkadot System Chains like Asset Hub and Revive.**

By abstracting the underlying PolkaVM mechanics, Apex SDK allows you to build sophisticated Solidity applications while leveraging Polkadot's shared security and interoperability.

## Key Features

- **Native PolkaVM Support**: Direct interaction with the PolkaVM backend for Solidity contracts.
- **System Chain Deployment**: Simplified deployment workflow for Asset Hub and Revive.
- **Unified API**: Shared contract management interfaces with Substrate and Revive modules.
- **Event Subscriptions**: Real-time event monitoring for system chain contracts.

## Quick Start

### Connecting to a System Chain

```rust
use apex_sdk::prelude::*;
use apex_sdk::polkavm::{ContractManager, ContractConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Connect to Asset Hub
    let contract_mgr = ContractManager::connect_env().await?;
    println!("Connected to PolkaVM on Asset Hub");

    Ok(())
}
```

### Deploying a Solidity Contract

```rust
let contract = contract_mgr.deploy(
    &bytecode,
    ContractConfig::default(),
    &deployer_account
).await?;

println!("Contract deployed at: {:?}", contract.address());
```

### Calling a Contract Method

```rust
let result = contract.call_method("transfer", &[recipient, amount]).await?;
println!("Call result: {:?}", result);
```

## Advanced Usage

### Event Monitoring

Subscribe to contract events in real-time:

```rust
let mut events = contract.events().subscribe().await?;
while let Some(event) = events.next().await {
    println!("System chain contract event: {:?}", event);
}
```

### Typed Contract Interfaces

Apex SDK supports generating type-safe interfaces for your Solidity ABI:

```rust
#[derive(Contract)]
#[abi = "path/to/abi.json"]
pub struct MyToken;

let token = contract_mgr.attach::<MyToken>(address);
let balance = token.balance_of(user).await?;
```

## Security Best Practices

- **Private Key Management**: Use secure environment variables or hardware security modules (HSM).
- **Bytecode Validation**: Always verify bytecode before deploying to production system chains.
- **Gas Fee Management**: Polkadot system chains use a different fee model; ensure your `ContractConfig` accounts for block limits.

## Troubleshooting

- **Deployment Failures**: Ensure the deployer account has sufficient native tokens on the target system chain.
- **RPC Issues**: Verify you are using a PolkaVM-compatible RPC endpoint for Asset Hub or Revive.
