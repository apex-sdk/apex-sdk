# Contributing to Apex SDK

**We welcome contributions that help us build the definitive System Chain Standard Library for Polkadot.**

## How to Contribute

1. **Bug Reports**: Open an issue for any bugs you find in the SDK or documentation.
2. **Feature Requests**: Propose new adapters for system chain features (e.g., new Asset Hub pallets).
3. **Draft PRs**: We encourage starting with a Draft Pull Request to discuss implementation patterns early.

## Development Setup

The SDK is written in Rust. You'll need the latest stable toolchain:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/apex-sdk/apex-sdk
cd apex-sdk

# Run the test suite
cargo test --all-features
```

## Contribution Guidelines

- **Standard Library Quality**: Since we aim to be a "standard library", we prioritize clarity, safety, and thorough documentation over complex abstractions.
- **Testing**: Every new feature must include unit tests and, where applicable, integration tests against a mock or live system chain.
- **Documentation**: Update the relevant MDX documentation file in `apex-sdk-web` whenever you change public APIs.

## Community

- **Discord**: Join our developer channels to discuss system chain patterns.
- **GitHub Discussions**: Use discussions for long-form design proposals.

## Recognition

Significant contributors are added to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file and recognized in our seasonal ecosystem updates.
