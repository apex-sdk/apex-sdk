# Test Networks Guide

**Developing on Polkadot System Chains requires a robust testnet environment. Apex SDK primarily supports the Westend and Paseo testnets for Asset Hub and Revive development.**

## Recommended Testnets

### Westend (Polkadot Testnet)

Westend is the primary testnet for Polkadot features, including all System Chain parathreads.

- **Purpose**: Testing core Polkadot features and System Chain logic.
- **SS58 Format**: 42
- **Asset Hub Endpoint**: `wss://westend-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io`
- **Revive Endpoint**: `wss://westend-revive-rpc.polkadot.io`

### Paseo (Community Testnet)

Paseo is a community-driven testnet that mirrors Polkadot's production environment.

- **Purpose**: Stable community testing and dApp development.
- **SS58 Format**: 0
- **Endpoint**: `wss://paseo.dotters.network`

## Configuration

### Connecting to a Testnet

```rust
use apex_sdk::prelude::*;
use apex_sdk::substrate::AssetManager;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Connect specifically to Westend Asset Hub
    let asset_mgr = AssetManager::connect("wss://westend-asset-hub-rpc.polkadot.io").await?;
    println!("Connected to Westend Asset Hub");

    Ok(())
}
```

## Faucets and Test Tokens

- **Westend WND**: Request WND from the [Polkadot Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/) or the Matrix `#westend_faucet` channel.
- **Paseo PAS**: Request PAS tokens from the community [Paseo Faucet](https://faucet.paseo.network/).

## Local Development (Dev Nodes)

For the fastest iteration cycle, we recommend running a local dev node of the system chains.

```bash
# Start a local Asset Hub dev node
apex dev-node start --chain asset-hub
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Drops**: Testnet RPCs can be less stable than mainnet. Always implement retry logic in your client.
- **Drip Limits**: Faucets have daily limits. Coordinate with your team to manage shared test accounts.
