# Apex CLI Guide

**The Apex CLI provides powerful tools for managing your System Chain projects, from initial setup to production deployment on Polkadot Asset Hub and Revive.**

## Installation

The CLI is part of the modular Apex SDK suite and can be installed via cargo:

```bash
cargo install apex-cli
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
apex --version
```

## Project Management

### Initialize a System Chain Project

```bash
# Create a new project focused on Polkadot System Chains
apex new my-system-dapp --template system-chain

# Specifically for Asset Hub or Revive
apex new my-asset-project --template asset-hub
apex new my-revive-project --template revive
```

Available templates:
- **system-chain**: General purpose Polkadot system chain setup.
- **asset-hub**: Optimized for Asset Hub (Assets, NFTs).
- **revive**: Optimized for Revive protocol and asset recovery.
- **minimal**: Basic Rust blockchain project setup.

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Build the project (optimized for PolkaVM and Substrate)
apex build

# Run unit and integration tests
apex test

# Start a local development node (requires Docker)
apex dev-node start
```

## Account and Key Management

### Manage Accounts

```bash
# List all managed accounts
apex account list

# Generate a new BIP-39 mnemonic and account
apex account generate --name dev-wallet

# Import an existing account
apex account import --seed "mnemonic words..."
```

## Network and Deployment

### Chain Connectivity

```bash
# Connect to a system chain RPC
apex chain connect asset-hub
apex chain connect revive

# Check chain status and metadata
apex chain status
```

### Contract Deployment (PolkaVM/Solidity)

```bash
# Deploy a Solidity contract to the current system chain
apex deploy --contract ./contracts/MyContract.sol

# Deploy with constructor arguments
apex deploy --contract ./MyToken.sol --args "1000,ApexToken"
```

## Advanced Tools

### Metadata Generation

Apex SDK relies on type-safe metadata. You can generate Rust bindings directly from a live chain:

```bash
apex generate bindings --network asset-hub
```

### Event Monitoring

```bash
# Monitor all System Chain events in real-time
apex monitor events

# Filter for specific pallets (Asset Hub)
apex monitor events --pallet assets
```

## Configuration

Project settings are managed in `apex.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "my-system-dapp"
template = "system-chain"

[networks.asset-hub]
rpc = "wss://asset-hub.polkadot.io"

[networks.revive]
rpc = "wss://revive-rpc.polkadot.io"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **WS Connection Errors**: Ensure your system supports WebSockets and the RPC endpoint is reachable.
- **Build Failures**: Verify you have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed for PolkaVM builds.
