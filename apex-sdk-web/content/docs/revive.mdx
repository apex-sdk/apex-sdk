# Revive & PolkaVM Integration

Apex SDK provides first-class support for the Revive protocol (Pallet-Revive) and PolkaVM/Solidity smart contracts on Polkadot Asset Hub, enabling seamless interoperability between native Substrate assets and EVM-compatible contracts.

## Overview

- **Revive**: Native asset recovery and management protocol for Polkadot Asset Hub.
- **PolkaVM**: EVM-compatible virtual machine for running Solidity contracts on Substrate.
- **Apex SDK**: Unified Rust interface for interacting with both native and EVM assets, contracts, and Revive operations.

## Quick Start

### 1. Enable Revive & PolkaVM Features

```toml
[dependencies]
apex-sdk = { version = "0.1", features = ["revive", "polkavm"] }
```

### 2. Basic Usage

```rust
use apex_sdk::prelude::*;
use apex_sdk::revive::{ReviveAdapter, ReviveConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), ApexError> {
    let revive = ReviveAdapter::new(ReviveConfig::default()).await?;
    // Native asset recovery
    let result = revive.recover_asset(account_id, asset_id).await?;
    println!("Recovered asset: {:?}", result);
    Ok(())
}
```

## Features

- Native asset recovery (Pallet-Revive)
- Cross-chain asset migration
- Solidity contract deployment and calls (PolkaVM)
- Unified account and asset management

## Example: Solidity Contract on Asset Hub

```rust
use apex_sdk::polkavm::{ContractManager, ContractConfig};

let contract = ContractManager::deploy(
    &bytecode,
    ContractConfig::default(),
    &deployer_account
).await?;

let result = contract.call_method("transfer", &[recipient, amount]).await?;
println!("Call result: {:?}", result);
```

## Best Practices

- Use typed metadata for all Substrate calls
- Validate asset IDs and account addresses
- Monitor events for asset recovery and contract execution

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the correct features are enabled in your `Cargo.toml`
- Use the latest Apex SDK for up-to-date Revive/PolkaVM support
- For contract errors, check PolkaVM logs and event subscriptions
